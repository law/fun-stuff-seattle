# Fun stuff to do in Seattle

First and foremost, our 'usual tourist traps' are... actually pretty fun, and I recommend you try at least a few of them as scheduling, etc, allows.  These are: 
- [Space Needle](https://www.spaceneedle.com/)
- [Pike Place Market](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/)
- [The Great Wheel](http://seattlegreatwheel.com/) (big ferris wheel down by the docks)
- [Experience Music Project (EMP)](https://www.mopop.org/), now called the 'MoPop museum'
- [Chihuly Glass Museum](https://www.chihulygardenandglass.com/)
- [Pacific Science Center](https://www.pacificsciencecenter.org/)
- [Bainbridge Island Ferry Ride](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/schedule/scheduledetail.aspx?departingterm=7&arrivingterm=3&roundtrip=true) (walk-on)
- [Seattle Library Tour](https://www.spl.org/) (Downtown location)

The less-common (but still fun) regular attractions: 
- [Seattle Underground Tours](http://www.undergroundtour.com/)
- [Argosy water cruises/tours](https://www.argosycruises.com/)
- [Bezos' Balls](https://www.seattlespheres.com/) (Amazon Spheres; free tours, but need to schedule)
- Movie at the [Cinerama](https://cinerama.com/) (gigantic wraparound screen)

Tons of hiking, etc, trails (some even public-transport accessible), such as:
- https://seattle.curbed.com/maps/car-free-hiking-trails-seattle
- https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/poo-poo-point
- https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/rattle-snake-ledge
- [Snoqualmie Falls](http://www.snoqualmiefalls.com/)

- [Boeing Aerospace Museum](https://www.museumofflight.org/)
- [Living Computer History Museum](https://livingcomputers.org/)
- Winery/distillery Tours in Woodinville (a town outside of Seattle, but well worth the bus ticket/car rental; Chateau Ste Michelle has one of the better tours IMHO) 
- [Electric Boat Co](https://theelectricboatco.com/) mini-boat rental by Lake Union 
- various food tours in the Belltown area of Seattle 

We are also known for our coffee.  I recommend skipping "the original Starbucks location in Pike Place Market", as it's not particularly special - generic SB menu, etc.  If you're looking for a mind-blowing cuppa, consider: 
- [Victrola](https://www.victrolacoffee.com/)
- [Vivace](http://espressovivace.com/)
- [Anchorhead](https://anchorheadcoffee.com/)
- [Fuel](http://www.fuelcoffeeseattle.com/) (multiple locations) 
- [Solstice](https://seattlecoffeescene.com/cafe-solstice/) (super comfy chairs, great wifi) 
- [Roy St Coffee & Tea](http://www.starbucks.co.th/coffeehouse/store-design/roy-street)
- [Ada's Cafe](https://www.seattletechnicalbooks.com/) (very decent coffee, also great hang/technical bookstore)
- [Coterie Worklounge](https://www.coterieworklounge.com/) (less 'mind blowing coffee' and more 'great coworking space')

Great breweries/bars: 
- [Optimism Brewery](https://optimismbrewing.com/)
- [Flatstick Pub](https://flatstickpub.com/)
- [Pioneer Square Saloon](https://www.yelp.com/biz/pioneer-square-saloon-seattle) 
- [The Central Saloon](https://www.centralsaloon.com/) ('oldest bar in Seattle'; also live music 7 nights/week) 

Great restaurants
- [Windy City pie](https://www.windycitypie.com/) (LEGIT chicago-style deep-dish pizza)
- [Sushi Kashiba](https://sushikashiba.com/) (must-visit legendary sushi; show up early (no reservations allowed) and try to get a seat at the sushi bar.  Order the 'omakase' (and nothing else), and be prepared to have your mind (and potentially wallet) blown open
- [Taylor Shellfish Farms](https://www.taylorshellfishfarms.com/) restaurants (Pioneer Square is a great location)
- [Marjorie](http://marjorierestaurant.com/)
- [Arashi Ramen](https://www.arashiramen.com/)

Great music places:
