# Fun stuff to do in Seattle

First and foremost, our 'usual tourist traps' are... actually pretty fun, and I recommend you try at least a few of them as scheduling, etc, allows.  These are: 
- Space Needle
- Pike Place Market
- The Wheel (big ferris wheel down by the docks)
- Experience Music Project (EMP), now called the 'MoPop museum'
- Chihuly Glass Museum
- Pacific Science Center
- Bainbridge Island Ferry Ride (walk-on)
- Seattle Library Tour (Downtown location)

The less-common (but still fun) regular attractions: 
- Seattle Underground Tours
- Argosy water cruises/tours
- Bezos' Balls (Amazon Spheres; free tours, but need to schedule)
- Movie at the Cinerama (gigantic wraparound screen)

Tons of hiking, etc, trails (some even public-transport accessible), such as:

- https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/poo-poo-point
- https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/rattle-snake-ledge
- Snoqualmie Falls

- Fremont Troll
- Boeing Aerospace Museum
- Living Computer History Museum 
- Winery/distillery Tours in Woodinville (a town outside of Seattle, but well worth the bus ticket/car rental; Chateau Ste Michelle has one of the better tours IMHO) 
- Electric Boat Co mini-boat rental by Lake Union 
- various food tours in the Belltown area of Seattle 

We are also known for our coffee.  I recommend skipping "the original Starbucks location in Pike Place Market", as it's not particularly special - generic SB menu, etc.  If you're looking for a mind-blowing cuppa, consider: 
- Victrola
- Vivace
- Anchorhead
- Fuel (multiple locations) 
- Solstice (super comfy chairs, great wifi) 
- Roy St Coffee & Tea
- Ada's Cafe (very decent coffee, also great hang/technical bookstore)
- Coterie Worklounge (less 'mind blowing coffee' and more 'great coworking space')

Great breweries/bars: 
- Optimism Brewery
- Flatstick Pub
- Pioneer Square Saloon 
- The Central Saloon ('oldest bar in Seattle'; also live music 7 nights/week) 

Great restaurants
- Windy City pie (LEGIT chicago-style deep-dish pizza)
- Sushi Kashiba (must-visit legendary sushi; show up early (no reservations allowed) and try to get a seat at the sushi bar.  Order the 'omakase' (and nothing else), and be prepared to have your mind (and potentially wallet) blown open
- Taylor Shellfish Farms restaurants (Pioneer Square is a great location)
- Marjorie
- Arashi Ramen
- Marmite
- Walrus and Carpenter
- Omega ouzeri (Greek food) 
- L’oursin (French seafood)
- 13 Coins (24h restaurant) 
- The 5-Point (24h Cafe)
- Pel Meni Dumpling Tzar (open to ~3am)

Great music places: 
- The Royal Room (low-key jazz/soul/funk space) 
- The High Dive (very divey, bands hit or miss, but the 'hits' can be very worth it
- Nectar Lounge 
- Conor Byrne
- Tractor Tavern
- The Triple Door
- Sunset Tavern
- The Showbox
- The J&M Cafe (decent dive-bar too)
